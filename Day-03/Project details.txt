hey chief, 
Today I am learning simple project in Python which is used to fundamental libraires of pandas. 
Make an example dataset with the following columns: Date, Product, Quantity, and Price. We use quantity * price to determine total sales.
Examining the Data: To inspect and comprehend the data's structure, use print().
Utilizing groupby(), we examine total sales by month and product.
Visualization of Data: We create a line chart showing total sales by month using matplotlib.
a bar graph showing overall sales for each product.
Extensions of the Project
For a more thorough analysis, try utilizing a larger dataset: a genuine sales dataset in CSV format.
Examine Trends: To expand on this assignment, you may examine sales patterns by season or day of the week.


This simple project is a great start for practicing data analysis with Pandas.
